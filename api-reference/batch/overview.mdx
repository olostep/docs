Batches allow you to process large numbers of URLs efficiently through our distributed architecture. Instead of making individual API calls, you can send up to 100,000 URLs in a single batch request.

## Features

- Process up to 100k URLs in a single batch
- Average completion time of 5-15 minutes for large batches
- Support for both HTML and Markdown content retrieval
- Real-time status tracking and progress monitoring
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed URLs
- Cost-effective parallel processing

## Basic Usage

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://batches.olostep.com/batches",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "batch_array": [
            {
                "custom_id": "product_123",
                "url": "https://example.com/product-123"
            },
            {
                "custom_id": "product_124",
                "url": "https://example.com/product-124"
            }
        ]
    }
)

batch_id = response.json()['batch_id']
```

## Limitations

| Limit                        | Value             |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Maximum URLs per batch       | 100,000           |
| Maximum URL length           | 2,048 characters  |
| Concurrent batches per org   | 10                |
| Batch results retention      | 7 days            |

## Workflow

1. Create a batch with your URLs
2. Monitor batch status
3. Retrieve completed URLs and content
4. Check for any failed URLs
5. Retry failed URLs if needed

## Best Practices

- Group related URLs in the same batch
- Use meaningful custom_ids for easy tracking
- Monitor batch progress regularly
- Implement proper error handling
- Store retrieved content promptly
