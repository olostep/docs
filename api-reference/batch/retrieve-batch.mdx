Got it! Here's a neat table format for the response fields in Mintlify:

### Response Fields

I see now! Hereâ€™s a neat, organized table format based on your original, without any unnecessary `ParamField` tags:

### Response Fields

| Field            | Type   | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| id               | String | Unique identifier for the batch                  |
| object           | String | Object type, always `batch`                      |
| status           | String | Current status: `in_progress`, `completed`       |
| created          | Number | Timestamp of batch creation (epoch in ms)        |
| total_urls       | Number | Total number of URLs in the batch                |
| completed_urls   | Number | Number of URLs successfully processed            |
| number_retried   | Number | Total retry attempts made                        |
| start_date       | String | Batch creation date (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`)  |

## Status Behavior

The `status` is automatically updated to `completed` when:
1. The number of `completed_urls` matches `total_urls`.
2. The previous status was `in_progress`.
