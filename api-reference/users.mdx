## users.get() Method

The `users.get()` method retrieves a user object, either creating a new one or returning an existing user object. The user object includes various properties, including a `tips` array, which stores tip objects.

### Parameters

The method doesn't accept any parameters.

It returns the user_data.
- `user_data` (object): An object containing user data with the following structure:

```javascript
const user_data = {
  "id": // 12 characters id,
  "email": null,
  "tips": [],  // Array to store tip objects
  "installed_at": // Date() object,
  "metadata": {},
  "synced_server": false
};
```

## Tips Array and Tip Object Structure

The `tips` array is a collection that holds tip objects, each representing a donation or tip. This array is part of a user object, storing the donation details associated with a user.

### Tip Object Structure

Each tip object within the `tips` array follows this structure:

- `id` (string): A unique identifier for the tip, typically generated using a timestamp or other unique identifier.
- `date` (string): The date when the tip was made, formatted in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).
- `epoch` (number): The timestamp in milliseconds since the epoch.
- `url` (string): It's the URL of the page on which the tip was processed
- `tip_details` (string): A JSON stringified representation of the tip details (coming from PayPal/Stripe)

Example of a tip object:

```json
{
  "id": "tip_1632589500000",
  "date": "2021-09-26",
  "epoch": 1632589500000,
  "url": "https://example.com/donation",
  "tip_details": "{\"amount\": 50, \"currency\": \"USD\", ...}"
}
