## Common Causes

- Using an incorrect resource ID
- Resource has expired or been deleted
- Typo in the parser name or version
- Referencing a resource from a different account

## Resolution

1. Verify the resource ID is correct
2. Check that the resource exists and hasn't expired
3. For parsers, verify the parser name and version are correct
4. Review available parsers in the [Parsers documentation](/features/structured-content/parsers)
