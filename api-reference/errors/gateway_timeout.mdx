## Overview

**HTTP Status Code:** 504

The request timed out before completing. This can happen with complex scrapes or slow-loading websites.

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `request_timeout` | Request exceeded the timeout limit |

## Example Response

```json
{
  "object": "error",
  "id": "error_abc123",
  "code": "request_timeout",
  "type": "https://docs.olostep.com/api-reference/errors/gateway_timeout",
  "status": 504,
  "title": "Gateway Timeout",
  "detail": "Your request timed out. Try increasing the timeout and making another request.",
  "created": 1704067200,
  "metadata": {}
}
```

## Common Causes

- Complex page with many resources
- Slow website response
- Too many browser actions
- Large file downloads
- Geographic routing delays

## Resolution

1. **Increase timeout** - Extend the request timeout in your client
2. **Simplify the request** - Reduce the number of actions
3. **Use wait_before_scraping** - Give the page more time to load
4. **Try a different country** - Geographic location can affect load times
5. **Retry the request** - Timeouts are often transient
