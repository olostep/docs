## Overview

**HTTP Status Code:** 429

Rate limit exceeded. You're making too many requests in a given time period.

|------|-------------|
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | Request rate limit has been exceeded |

## Example Response

```json
{
  "object": "error",
  "id": "error_abc123",

  "type": "https://docs.olostep.com/api-reference/errors/too_many_requests",
  "status": 429,
  "title": "Too Many Requests",
  "detail": "You've reached your rate limits for this API. Please try again later.",

```

## Rate Limits

Rate limits vary by plan. Check your current limits in your [dashboard](https://olostep.com/dashboard).

## Resolution

1. **Implement exponential backoff** - Wait and retry with increasing delays
2. **Use batch processing** - Process multiple URLs in a single batch request
3. **Spread requests over time** - Avoid bursting all requests at once
4. **Contact support** - Request higher rate limits if needed

## Example: Exponential Backoff

```python
import time
import random

def request_with_backoff(make_request, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return make_request()
        except RateLimitError:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            
            # Exponential backoff with jitter
            delay = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
            time.sleep(delay)
```
