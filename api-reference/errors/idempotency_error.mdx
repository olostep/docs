## Overview

**HTTP Status Code:** 409

The request conflicts with an in-progress or completed idempotent request. This occurs when using idempotency keys to ensure exactly-once processing of requests.

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `idempotency_key_in_progress` | A request with this idempotency key is currently being processed |

## Example Response

```json
{
  "object": "error",
  "id": "error_abc123",
  "code": "idempotency_key_in_progress",
  "type": "https://docs.olostep.com/api-reference/errors/idempotency_error",
  "status": 409,
  "title": "Idempotency Error",
  "detail": "A request with this idempotency key is currently being processed. Please wait and retry.",
  "created": 1704067200,
  "metadata": {}
}
```

## Common Causes

- Sending duplicate requests with the same idempotency key before the first request completes
- Network timeouts causing client retries while the original request is still processing
- Race conditions when multiple clients attempt the same operation

## Resolution

1. Wait for the in-progress request to complete (typically 1-5 seconds)
2. Retry the request after a short delay with exponential backoff
3. Poll for the result of the original request if you have the batch ID
