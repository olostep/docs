## Overview

**HTTP Status Code:** 501

The service is temporarily unavailable or at maximum capacity. This is typically a temporary condition.

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `max_capacity_reached` | Service is at maximum capacity |

## Example Response

```json
{
  "object": "error",
  "id": "error_abc123",
  "code": "max_capacity_reached",
  "type": "https://docs.olostep.com/api-reference/errors/service_unavailable",
  "status": 501,
  "title": "Service Unavailable",
  "detail": "We have currently reached our maximum capacity for this feature flag. Consider retrying in a few minutes.",
  "created": 1704067200,
  "metadata": {}
}
```

## Resolution

1. **Wait and retry** - Capacity issues are typically temporary
2. **Implement exponential backoff** - Gradually increase wait times between retries
3. **Use batch processing** - Reduce the number of concurrent requests
4. **Contact support** - If you consistently hit capacity limits
