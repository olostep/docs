## request()

This function provides the ability to request tips natively within your extension.

It's strongly recommended that you call this method immediately after a user has just benefited from your product, so to increase the possibility of receiving a tip and not bothering your users.

The request method is internationalized out of the box and will automatically translate the tip request into the user's language if the language is supported. If you want to disable this functionality, you can do so by setting the `translation_enabled` parameter to `false`.

It will also detect the user's currency (from the IP address) and display the converted amount in the user's local currency (alongside the original currency and amount).

The user will still be charged in the original currency you specify using the `currency` parameter. The conversion is only for display purposes.

### Parameters

It allows for customization using the following parameters:

- `item` (string): Specifies the item for which a tip is requested. Options include: ["coffee", "heart", "beer", "pizza", "book"].

- `price_per_item` (number): Sets the price per item in the specified currency. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit. Options range from 100 to 2000.
