Here you will find examples on how to use the Olostep API to scrape web pages.
Examples are provided in Python, NodeJS and TypeScript. If you need support with any other language, please let us know at hamza@olostep.com

The examples provided use the following libraries:
- Python: requests
- NodeJS: fetch
- TypeScript: fetch

We don't have an SDK for the Olostep API yet.

In order to scrape a web page, you need:
1. Your API keys (you can request one for free [here](https://p5iqqpnnrjy.typeform.com/to/aq0SOcev?typeform-source=www.olostep.com))
2. The URL of the page you want to scrape.

All other parameters are set to default values. If you want to change them, you can do so by passing them as query parameters to the endpoint.
You can find the list of parameters under the "Query Parameters" section [here](https://docs.olostep.com/api-reference/start-agent).
