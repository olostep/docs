Olostep's API is designed around objects. Understanding this design helps you build more effective integrations. This design is inspired by [Stripe's API philosophy](https://docs.stripe.com/payments-api/tour#everything-is-an-object).

## Everything is an Object

Every resource in Olostep is an object with a unique identifier. Whether you create it via the API, SDK, or dashboard — you get back an object you can reference, update, and query.

| Resource | Object ID Format | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Scrape | `scrape_*` | `scrape_abc123` |
| Batch | `batch_*` | `batch_xyz789` |
| Crawl | `crawl_*` | `crawl_def456` |
| Map | `map_*` | `map_ghi012` |
| Answer | `answer_*` | `answer_jkl345` |
| File | `file_*` | `file_mno678` |
| Schedule | `schedule_*` | `schedule_pqr901` |

---

## Objects Can Have Lifecycles

Some Olostep objects track state through a `status` field. This state machine pattern lets you know exactly where each resource is in its lifecycle.

### Batches

Batches have two levels of status: the **batch** itself and individual **items**.

**Batch Status:**

```
in_progress → completed
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `in_progress` | URLs are being scraped |
| `completed` | Processing finished |

<Note>
**Batch-level failures are extremely rare.** Batches almost always complete — even if some URLs fail, the batch itself reaches `completed` status. In the rare case of a catastrophic infrastructure failure (e.g., LLM service outage during enrichment), the batch may fail. This affects less than 0.01% of batches.
</Note>

**Item Status:**

Each URL in a batch is tracked as an individual item with its own status:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `success` | URL scraped successfully |
| `failed` | URL could not be scraped |

Items can fail due to:
- URL is blocked or returns an error
- Parser output missing
- Network/fetch errors

Failed items include an `error` object with `code` and `message` explaining the failure. The batch still completes — check each item's status when processing results.

### Crawls

```
in_progress → completed
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `in_progress` | Actively discovering and processing URLs |
| `completed` | Crawling finished |

<Note>
**Crawls always complete.** Even if a crawl finds 0 URLs (due to robots.txt blocking or invalid start URL), the crawl status will be `completed`. Check the `pages_count` field to verify results.
</Note>

## Retrieve Pattern

Many objects produce content that can be retrieved later. The `retrieve_id` pattern lets you fetch content without re-processing.

```bash
# Get content using retrieve_id
curl "https://api.olostep.com/v1/retrieve?retrieve_id=6h89o8u1kt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

This pattern is used by:
- **Batch items** — Each processed URL gets a `retrieve_id`
- **Crawl pages** — Each crawled page gets a `retrieve_id`

The `/v1/retrieve` endpoint accepts `formats` parameter to specify which content types to return (`html`, `markdown`, `json`, `text`).

---

## Webhooks: Event-Driven Updates

Instead of polling for status changes, configure [webhooks](/api-reference/common/webhooks) to receive events when objects change state.

```json
{
  "event": "batch.completed",
  "data": {
    "id": "batch_xyz789",
    "status": "completed",
    "items_total": 100,
    "items_completed": 100
  }
}
```

---

## Metadata: Your Data Alongside Ours

Attach custom key-value pairs to objects using [metadata](/api-reference/common/metadata). This lets you link Olostep resources to your internal systems.

```json
{
  "items": [{"url": "https://example.com"}],
  "metadata": {
    "order_id": "12345",
    "customer": "acme-corp"
  }
}
```

## Summary

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Objects** | Every resource has a unique ID and is queryable |
| **Lifecycles** | Track progress via `status` field |
| **Retrieve** | Fetch content later with `retrieve_id` |
| **Webhooks** | Get notified when state changes |
| **Metadata** | Attach your own data to any object |
