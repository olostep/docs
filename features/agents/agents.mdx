The Agents API allows you to create and manage autonomous research agents that can perform complex, multi-step tasks on a schedule. These agents can search the web, extract data, and deliver results automatically.

## Access Requirements

The Agents API is currently available to select customers. To get access, please:

## How to use the Agents API

In the example below, we will create an agent that searches for portfolio companies from various funds and organizes the data into a Google Sheet with scheduled execution.

<CodeGroup>

```python agents.py
import requests

API_URL = 'https://api.olostep.com/v1/agents' # endpoint available to select customers
API_KEY = '<token>'

headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
data = {
    "prompt": '''
      Search every portfolio company from every fund from 
      (https://www.vcsheet.com/funds) and return the results into a google sheet 
      with the following columns (Fund Name, Fund Website 
      URL, Fund LinkedIn URL, Portfolio Company Name, Portfolio
      Company URL, Portfolio Company LinkedIn URL). Run every week 
      on Monday at 9:00 AM. Send an email to steve@example.com when 
      new portfolio companies are added to any of these funds.  
    ''',
    "model": "gpt-4.1"
}

response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=data)
result = response.json()

print(f"Agent ID: {result['id']}")
print(f"Status: {result['status']}")
# You can then schedule this agent
```

</CodeGroup>
