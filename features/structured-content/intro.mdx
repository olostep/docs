By default, Olostep supports returning content in various formats including:
- HTML
- Text
- raw_PDF
- Markdown

**For some use cases you might not need the entire content but only specified, structured and clean data in JSON format.**

To achieve this, you may use: 

- **[Parsers](./parsers)**: Ideal for high-volume, consistent, recurring website scraping
- **[LLM Extraction](./llm-extraction)**: Ideal for flexible extraction needs or websites with changing structures

Both methods provide clean, structured JSON data that can be immediately used in your applications without additional processing.
