title: Using LLM Extraction
---

For websites with changing structures or one-off extraction needs, Olostep offers LLM-powered extraction. This approach:

- Feeds the content to a Large Language Model
- Instructs the model to parse and return only the specified data
- Returns a clean JSON structure containing exactly what you need

```python
import requests
import json

def extract_with_llm():
url = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/scrapes"

    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <API_KEY>",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    data = {
        "url_to_scrape": "https://www.berklee.edu/events/stefano-marchese-friends",
        "formats": ["markdown", "llm_extract"],
        "schema": {
            "event": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "title": {"type": "string"},
                    "date": {"type": "string"},
                    "description": {"type": "string"},
                    "venue": {"type": "string"},
                    "address": {"type": "string"},
                    "start_time": {"type": "string"}
                }
            }
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    result = response.json()

    # The LLM extract will be available in the result
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))

    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
extract_with_llm()
```
