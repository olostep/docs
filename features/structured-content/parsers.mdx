Custom parsers are ideal when you need to extract data at scale in a recurrent way from the same websites. This approach is  cost-efficient and fast as it extracts data directly from static HTML/CSS selectors and return you only the required JSON.

We offer pre-built parsers for popular websites and can create custom parsers for your specific needs. We can also enable your account to pass custom parsers directly to the APIs.

### Pre-Built Parsers

We offer several pre-built parsers for popular websites:
- Google Search: `@olostep/google-search`
- Amazon Product: `@olostep/amazon-it-product`
- Linkedin Profile: get in touch with us to get the parser ID
- TikTok data extraction: get in touch with us to get the parser ID
- Google News: get in touch with us to get the parser ID
- Google Maps: get in touch with us to get the parser ID

### Example Usage

```python
import requests
import json

endpoint = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/scrapes"
payload = {
    "formats": ["parser_extract"],
    "parser_extract": {"parser_id": "@olostep/google-search"},
    "url_to_scrape": "https://www.google.com/search?q=alexander+the+great&gl=us&hl=en",
    "wait_before_scraping": 0,
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR-API-KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.request("POST", endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4))
```
