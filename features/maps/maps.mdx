The Maps endpoint allows you to extract sitemap URLs from any website. Simply provide a website URL to get a list of all sitemap URLs associated with that domain. This is useful for content discovery and site structure analysis.

## Extracting Sitemaps

To extract sitemaps from a website, send a POST request with the target **url** to be processed. The endpoint typically responds within seconds, providing a comprehensive list of sitemap URLs.

<CodeGroup>

```python maps.py
import requests
import time

# Define the API URL and your API key
API_URL = 'https://api.olostep.com'
API_KEY = '<your_token>'

# Set the headers for the requests
HEADERS = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'
}

# Data for the request
payload = {
    "url": "https://docs.olostep.com"
}

# Make the request and measure latency
start_time = time.time()
response = requests.post(f'{API_URL}/v1/maps', headers=HEADERS, json=payload)
latency = round((time.time() - start_time) * 1000, 2)

# Print results
print(f"Latency: {latency}ms")
print("\nResponse Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("\nResponse Body:")
print(response.text)
```

The response will include all discovered sitemap URLs for the specified website. This endpoint is particularly useful when you need to:
- Discover all content pages on a website
- Analyze site structure and hierarchy
- Prepare URLs for batch processing
