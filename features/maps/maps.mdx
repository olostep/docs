description: Get all the URLs on a website.
---
Through the Olostep `/v1/maps` endpoint you can get all the URLs on a website. This is useful for content discovery, site structure analysis (e.g., SEO), or deciding which URLs you want to scrape next.

- Get all URLs on a website (including sitemaps and discovered links)
- Use special patterns to include/exclude paths (e.g. `/blog/**`)
- Paginate large responses with `cursor` (up to 10MB per response)
- Limit volume with `top_n`

For details, see the [Map Endpoint API Reference](/api-reference/maps/create).

## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# pip install requests

import requests
```

```js Node
// npm install node-fetch

// ESM
import fetch from 'node-fetch'

// CommonJS
const fetch = require('node-fetch')
```

```bash cURL
# macOS: builtin curl is fine
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

Send a POST request with the website `url`. Optionally pass `include_urls`, `exclude_urls` (glob patterns), and `top_n`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests
import json

endpoint = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/maps"

payload = {
    "url": "https://docs.olostep.com"
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

```js Node
const res = await fetch('https://api.olostep.com/v1/maps', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ url: 'https://docs.olostep.com' })
})
console.log(await res.json())
```

```bash cURL
curl -s -X POST "https://api.olostep.com/v1/maps" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLOSTEP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://docs.olostep.com"
  }'
```

The response time is typically within seconds but can take up to 120 seconds for more complex websites. It can extract all URLs from a website, even backlinks and those not present in the Sitemaps. You can also also decide the URLs paths you want to include or exclude from the response.


By default the endpoint returns around 100k URLs in a single call (10MB max). If the response includes more data, the API returns a `cursor` parameter which can be used for pagination and getting the subsequent URLs. For more details refer to the [API Reference](/api-reference/maps/create#body-cursor)

This endpoint is particularly useful when you need to:
- Discover all content pages on a website
- Analyze site structure and hierarchy
- Prepare URLs for batch processing
- Decide which specific URLs to scrape

For more fine-grained control over the URLs returned you can use the params `include_urls` and  `exclude_urls`.

### Example

Let's say that from www.brex.com you want to extract all the urls that have the paths after `/product/` e.g `https://www.brex.com/product/api/no-code` but also include `www.brex.com/product`.
You can use the following code:

<CodeGroup>

    ```python maps.py
    import requests
    
    endpoint = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/maps"
    
    payload = {
        "url": "https://www.brex.com/",
        "include_urls": ["/product", "/product/**"],
        "top_n": 100000
    }
    
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
    
    print(response.text)
    ```

    ```js Node
    const endpoint = 'https://api.olostep.com/v1/maps'

    const res = await fetch(endpoint, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        url: 'https://www.brex.com/',
        include_urls: ['/product', '/product/**'],
        top_n: 100000
      })
    })
    console.log(await res.text())
    ```

    ```bash cURL
    curl -s -X POST "https://api.olostep.com/v1/maps" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLOSTEP_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "url": "https://www.brex.com/",
        "include_urls": ["/product", "/product/**"],
        "top_n": 100000
      }'
    ```

## How is it billed?
Each request sent to the maps endpoint is billed as 1 credit. Then for every extra 1000 urls returned in the response an additional credit is used.

## Conclusion

The maps endpoint is a powerful tool for content discovery and site analysis. It provides a comprehensive list of URLs on a website, enabling you to extract content from specific pages or analyze the site structure. This endpoint is particularly useful for SEO professionals, content marketers, AI agents who need to analyze website content or structure.
