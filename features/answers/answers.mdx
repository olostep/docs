Through the Olostep `/v1/answers` endpoint you can search the web with natural language and return AI‑powered answers and data in the JSON shape you want. This lets you ground your products on real-world data and sources, enrich data points or spreadsheets

- Ask a question or give AI a data point you want to enrich
- Optional: specify the JSON structure you want back

It will:
- Search, clean, validate and return the data it found on the Web 
- Return sources used to generate the answer
- Handle uncertainty with `NOT_FOUND` values when data cannot be verified 

For details, see the [Answers Endpoint API Reference](/api-reference/answers/create).

By default we use a generic web index and a cost‑efficient LLM validator.

But enterprise customers have access to proprietary industry specific indexes, exclusive private data and custom LLM models most suited for their use case. Contact us for access: info@olostep.com



## Use cases
The answers endpoint can be used to:
 - Ground AI applications on real world data and facts
 - Enrich spreadsheets and data points for Recruting, Finance, Consulting, and Sales

Here's a demo of an AI powered spreadsheet powered by the Answers endpoint:

## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# pip install requests

import requests
```

```js Node
// npm install node-fetch

// ESM
import fetch from 'node-fetch'

// CommonJS
const fetch = require('node-fetch')
```

```bash cURL
# macOS: builtin curl is fine
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

Ask a question and pass a JSON schema to guide the output. You can also not pass the `json` parameter and the API will return a json object with the answer text inside the `result` field.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests, json

endpoint = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/answers"
payload = {
  "task": "What is the latest book by J.K. Rowling?",
  "json": {"book_title": "", "author": "", "release_date": ""}
}
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

```js Node
const res = await fetch('https://api.olostep.com/v1/answers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    task: 'What is the latest book by J.K. Rowling?',
    json: { book_title: '', author: '', release_date: '' }
  })
})
console.log(await res.json())
```

```bash cURL
curl -s -X POST "https://api.olostep.com/v1/answers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLOSTEP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task": "What is the latest book by J.K. Rowling?",
    "json": {"book_title": "", "author": "", "release_date": ""}
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response

Like other Olostep endpoints, you will receive a `answer` object in response. The `answer` object has a few properties like `id` and `result`.

```json
{
  "id": "answer_9bi0sbj9xa",
  "object": "answer",
  "created": 1760327323,
  "metadata": {},
  "task": "What is the latest book by J.K. Rowling?",
  "result": {
    "json_content": "{\"book_title\":\"The Hallmarked Man\",\"author\":\"J.K. Rowling (as Robert Galbraith)\",\"release_date\":\"2 September 2025\"}",
    "json_hosted_url": "https://olostep-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/answer_9bi0sbj9xa.json",
    "sources": [
      "https://strikefans.com/the-books/",
      "https://www.facebook.com/groups/496943608606523/posts/1136830134617864/",
      "https://robert-galbraith.com/strike-books/",
      "https://www.novelsuspects.com/series-list/robert-galbraith-cormoran-strike-series-in-order/",
      "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1na833a/jk_rowlings_new_strike_novel_900_pages_of_romance/",
      "https://www.harrypotter.com/writing-by-jk-rowling",
      "https://stories.jkrowling.com/book-news/",
      "https://deadline.com/2024/09/jk-rowling-writing-futuristic-novel-1236093909/",
      "https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/1cl1shn/jk_rowling_may_2024_ive_got_six_more_books_in_my/",
      "https://www.jkrowling.com/news/"
    ]
  }
}
```

Your requested answer, formatted according to the `json` parameter, is in `response.result.json_content` and the list of sources in `response.result.sources`. You can parse the stringified JSON to access the structured data.

```json
{
  "book_title": "The Hallmarked Man",
  "author": "J.K. Rowling",
  "release_date": "September 2, 2025"
}
```

Sources example:

```json
[
    "https://www.harrypotter.com/writing-by-jk-rowling",
    "https://stories.jkrowling.com/book-news/",
    "https://deadline.com/2024/09/jk-rowling-writing-futuristic-novel-1236093909/",
    "https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasticBeasts/comments/1cl1shn/jk_rowling_may_2024_ive_got_six_more_books_in_my/",
    "https://www.jkrowling.com/news/"
]
```

When you don't pass the `json` parameter, the API will return a json object with the answer text inside the `result` field.

```json
{
  "result": "The latest book by J.K. Rowling is The Hallmarked Man."
}
```

### Flexible `json` parameter

- Provide a JSON object with empty values as a schema, or a string describing the data you want.
- If the agent isn’t confident, it returns `NOT_FOUND` for that field.

```python Python
import requests, json

endpoint = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/answers"
payload = {
  "task": "how much did Olostep raise?", 
  "json": {
    "amount": ""
  }
}
headers = {
  "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

This would return:

```json
{
  "amount": "NOT_FOUND"
}
```
