With contexts you can pass custom cookies to the API. This allows you to reuse cookies, authentication, and stored data for your API requests.

This is useful to preserve authentication and session data between requests without needing to log in repeatedly, or to reuse cached data for subsequent requests.


### Creating a Context

Here is how you can create a context to pass custom cookies to the API:

1. Install the Olostep browser plugin from here: [Olostep browser plugin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/olostep/mjalbmdidmklbojfgakdpbifkgjjilkh)
2. Visit the website for which you want to save the cookies/authentication
3. Login to the website with the credentials you want to save
4. Click on the Olostep plugin icon and select "Submit Context"
5. Copy the context_id (which will be something like `ctx_yylqbfayto`) from the plugin and use it in your API requests


### Using Context in the API requests

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/scrapes"

payload = {
    "url_to_scrape": "https://www.feizy.com/account-dashboard",
    "formats": ["html", "markdown"],
    "remove_css_selectors": "none",
    "country": "US",
    "context": {
        "context_id": "ctx_yylqbfayto"
    }
}

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <API_KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

# Parse the JSON response
data = response.json()

# Print the JSON with proper indentation
print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
```

### Conclusion

With context you are applying the same cookies and authentication to the API requests as you have saved in the browser plugin. This allows you to reuse cookies, authentication, and stored data for your API requests.
