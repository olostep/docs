Through the Olostep `/v1/batches` endpoint you can process thousands of URLs in one job. Use it to extract content or structured data at scale.

- Submit up to 10k URLs per batch; run many batches in parallel
- Constant processing time (~5â€“8 minutes) regardless of batch size
- Use parsers to return structured JSON, or retrieve markdown/html via `/v1/retrieve`

For details, see the [Batch Endpoint API Reference](/api-reference/batches/create).

## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# pip install requests

import requests
```

```js Node
// npm install node-fetch

// ESM
import fetch from 'node-fetch'

// CommonJS
const fetch = require('node-fetch')
```

```bash cURL
# macOS: builtin curl is fine
```

</CodeGroup>

## Start a batch

Provide an array of `items` with a `custom_id` and `url`. These are the URLs that will be processed in the batch, the `custom_id` is an internal unique identifier for the URL.

Optionally pass `parser` or `country`. Through the `parser` parameter you can specify the parser to use for the batch, this will return structured JSON from the pages.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import requests

API_URL = "https://api.olostep.com/v1"

    return items

    }
    headers = {

    }

    }
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)

    print(f"You can check the status of the batch at: {API_URL}/batches/{batch_id}?token={API_KEY}")

    wait_until_complete(batch_id)

    print("Fetching completed items...")
    completed_items = get_completed_items(batch_id)

    print("Retrieving content...")
    for item in completed_items:
        retrieve_id = item["retrieve_id"]
        print(f"\nRetrieving content for item {item['retrieve_id']}...")
        content = retrieve_content(retrieve_id)
        print(f"\n---\nURL: {item['url']}\nCustom ID: {item['custom_id']}\n")
        #print("Markdown:\n", content.get("markdown_content", "[No markdown found]"))
        print("JSON:\n", content.get("json_content", "[No JSON found]"))

        # If you want to see the parsed content specifically
        if "parsed_content" in content:
            print("\nParsed Content:")
            print(content["parsed_content"])
```

```js Node
const API_URL = 'https://api.olostep.com/v1'
const payload = {
  items: [
    { custom_id: 'item-1', url: 'https://www.google.com/search?q=stripe&gl=us&hl=en' },
    { custom_id: 'item-2', url: 'https://www.google.com/search?q=paddle&gl=us&hl=en' },
  ],
  parser: { id: '@olostep/google-search' }
}
const res = await fetch(`${API_URL}/batches`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})
console.log(await res.json())
```

```bash cURL
curl -s -X POST "https://api.olostep.com/v1/batches" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLOSTEP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      { "custom_id": "item-1", "url": "https://www.google.com/search?q=stripe&gl=us&hl=en" },
      { "custom_id": "item-2", "url": "https://www.google.com/search?q=paddle&gl=us&hl=en" }
    ],
    "parser": { "id": "@olostep/google-search" }
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

Since Olostep follows an object-oriented approach, you will receive a `batch` object in response. The `batch` object has a few properties like `id` and `status`.

```json
{
    "id": "batch_z7n7hwh45x",
    "object": "batch",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "created": 1760329882951,
    "total_urls": 10,
    "completed_urls": 0,
    "number_retried": 0,
    "batch_parser": "@olostep/google-search",
    "batch_country": "RANDOM",
    "start_date": "2025-10-12"
}
```

## Check batch status

Poll until `status` is `completed`. You can also check the `completed_urls` property to see how many URLs have been processed.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
def get_batch_info(batch_id):
    return requests.get(
        f"{API_URL}/batches/{batch_id}",
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
        }
    ).json()

batch_id = '<BATCH_ID>'
info = get_batch_info(batch_id)
print(info['status'])
```

```js Node
const batchId = '<BATCH_ID>'
const info = await fetch(`${API_URL}/batches/${batchId}`, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' }
}).then(r => r.json())
console.log(info.status)
```

```bash cURL
curl -s -X GET "https://api.olostep.com/v1/batches/<BATCH_ID>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLOSTEP_API_KEY"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Retrieve content

Use the `retrieve_id` from each item with `/v1/retrieve` to fetch `html_content`, `markdown_content`, or `json_content`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
def retrieve_content(retrieve_id):
    return requests.get(f"{API_URL}/retrieve", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}, params={"retrieve_id": retrieve_id}).json()

items = list_items('<BATCH_ID>', limit=5)['items']
for item in items:
    content = retrieve_content(item['retrieve_id'])
    print(content.get('json_content'))
```

```js Node
const content = await fetch(`${API_URL}/retrieve?retrieve_id=<RETRIEVE_ID>`, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' }
}).then(r => r.json())
console.log(content.json_content)
```

```bash cURL
curl -s -G "https://api.olostep.com/v1/retrieve" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLOSTEP_API_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode "retrieve_id=<RETRIEVE_ID>"
```

</CodeGroup>

## List items (paginate with cursor)

Fetch items using `cursor` and `limit`. Prefer using `/v1/retrieve` with `retrieve_id` for content.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
def list_items(batch_id, cursor=None, limit=10):
    params = { 'cursor': cursor, 'limit': limit }
    return requests.get(f"{API_URL}/batches/{batch_id}/items", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}, params=params).json()

cursor = 0
while True:
    result = list_items('<BATCH_ID>', cursor=cursor, limit=10)
    for item in result['items']:
        print(item['custom_id'], item['url'], item['retrieve_id'])
    if 'cursor' not in result:
        break
    cursor = result['cursor']
```

```js Node
let cursor = 0
while (true) {
  const result = await fetch(`${API_URL}/batches/<BATCH_ID>/items?cursor=${cursor}&limit=10`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' }
  }).then(r => r.json())
  result.items.forEach(i => console.log(i.custom_id, i.url, i.retrieve_id))
  if (result.cursor === undefined) break
  cursor = result.cursor
}
```

```bash cURL
curl -s -G "https://api.olostep.com/v1/batches/<BATCH_ID>/items" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OLOSTEP_API_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode "cursor=0" \
  --data-urlencode "limit=10"
```

</CodeGroup>

When you run the provided example code, you will receive a response like the following

```json

Since we passed the parser to retrieve the structured JSON and we are printing only that, the response contains:

- **json_content** with structured search results including:
- `searchParameters`: Information about the search query
- `knowledgeGraph`: Detailed information about the search subject (when available)
- `organic`: List of search results with title, link, position, and snippet
- `peopleAlsoAsk`: Related questions that users commonly search for
- `relatedSearches`: Suggested related search queries

If you don't want the structured JSON but simply the markdown or html you can retrieve those from the retrieve endpoint. 

## Important Notes

If you want structured JSON you need to pass the specific parser to the API before making the requests. For example if you want to get the JSON from Google Search you will pass this parser `"parser": {"id": "@olostep/google-search"}`
You can create your own parsers to retrieve the data you want from any page. Reach out to `info@olostep.com` to learn more.

## Conclusion

The batch endpoint is useful if you need to get data from many URLs in a short period of time. You need to already have the list of urls you want to get the data from.

Common applications can be:

- Price tracking services that monitor multiple e-commerce sites for price changes on products
- Website monitoring tools that check for content updates across numerous pages
- Data aggregation for concert organizers tracking ticket availability across multiple venues
- Search engines gathering and indexing content from many websites simultaneously
- News aggregators collecting articles from various publications
- Real estate platforms monitoring property listings across multiple sites
- Job boards aggregating openings from company career pages
- Financial data services tracking stock prices and market information
- Social media monitoring tools analyzing mentions across different platforms
- Academic research gathering data from multiple sources for analysis


 It's better to use the batch endpoint if you want the content from 100 to 10k urls at a time. If you need to scrape less than 50 urls at a time we recommended using the scrape endpoint and submit the urls in parallel since it's faster than the batch endpoint.
