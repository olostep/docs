## Overview

Olostep's APIs offer web scraping, search, and crawling capabilities to power your GEO/SEO platform

This includes everything from large-scale [crawling](/features/crawls/crawls), website [mapping](/features/maps/maps) (identifying all URLs from a website), scraping and parsing data (from sources like Google AIOs, AI Mode, Perplexity, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, G2, Reddit, business websites, etc.) to running these tasks on a schedule and more. 

The API is used by several VC-backed startups in the space.

## Why use Olostep for GEO?

- **Scalability:** Process millions of URLs by running batches of 100k urls in parallel.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** It's the most cost-effective API on the market. It's also 40% cheaper than in-house solutions (without even considering the engineering resources dedicated)
- **Reliability/Trigger rate:** Endpoints are designed to be reliable and offer best-in-class data quality.
- **Multiple Formats:** Retrieve parsed data directly in JSON, html or markdown format.
- **Custom Parsers:** Extract only the relevant JSON information with our parsers or create and pass your own to the API.
- **Automation:** Set up scheduled tasks that run at predefined times/regular intervals.
- **Good DX:** We offer Python and NodeJS SDKs, an object-oriented API, Webhook support, and more.

  "prompt": "what is mitochondria",
  "answer_markdown": "Mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are \n\nmembrane-bound **organelles found within almost all eukaryotic cells** . They are popularly known as the **\"powerhouses of the cell\"**  because they generate most of the chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions.  \n\nPrimary Function: Energy Production  \n\nThe main function of mitochondria is to produce the cell's primary energy-carrying molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process is called cellular respiration or oxidative phosphorylation, which involves breaking down nutrients (like glucose and fatty acids) using oxygen to release a large amount of energy.  \n\nCells that require a high amount of energy, such as muscle, liver, brain, and kidney cells, contain hundreds or even thousands of mitochondria to meet their metabolic demands.  \n\nOther Key Functions  \n\nBeyond energy production, mitochondria are involved in several other critical cellular processes:  \n\n* **Cell Signaling**  They participate in various signaling pathways, communicating with other organelles to regulate cellular activities.\n* **Programmed Cell Death (Apoptosis)**  Mitochondria play a central role in initiating apoptosis, a necessary process for removing damaged or infected cells from the body.\n* **Calcium Storage and Regulation**  They act as storage sites and buffers for calcium ions, which are vital for processes like muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release.\n* **Synthesis of Important Molecules**  They contribute to the synthesis of steroid hormones, certain parts of the blood (like heme), and some neurotransmitters.\n\nUnique Characteristics  \n\nMitochondria have several unique features that distinguish them from other organelles:  \n\n* **Double Membrane**  They are enclosed by two membranes—an outer membrane and a highly folded inner membrane (called cristae). The folds in the inner membrane increase the surface area available for the chemical reactions of energy production.\n* **Their Own DNA**  Mitochondria contain their own small, circular DNA genome (mtDNA), which is separate from the cell's nuclear DNA. This mtDNA is almost exclusively inherited from the mother.\n* **Bacterial Origin**  The presence of their own DNA and other structural similarities strongly supports the endosymbiotic theory, which suggests that mitochondria were once free-living bacteria that were engulfed by a larger host cell over a billion years ago, forming a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nDysfunctional mitochondria can lead to various health problems, including rare inherited conditions and more common diseases like Parkinson's, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.  \n\nAI can make mistakes, so double-check responses \n\nCreating a public link... \n\nYou can now share this thread with others.\n\nThank you\n\nYour feedback helps Google improve. See our [ Privacy Policy ](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).\n\nShare more feedback Report a problem Close \n\nWhat links mitochondria dysfunction to specific diseases?\n\nWhat reactions occur in the mitochondrial matrix?\n\nExplain more about the endosymbiotic theory of mitochondria",

            "snippet": "Willy Chavarria has had a standout year in fashion, highlighted by his dynamic collaborations with Adidas. After launching his first collection in January 2025 and presenting an impactful runway in Paris, Chavarria closes the year with a final Adidas drop that showcases his bold, distinctive style. The collection includes oversized apparel like zip mock necks, half-zips with rose embroidery, long-sleeve soccer jerseys, and nearly ankle-length pull-away shorts.\n\nThe main focus, however, is the footwear. Chavarria reimagines Adidas classics, particularly the Forum line. Highlights include a blacked-out Forum Low with a redesigned sole and premium leather upper, and a classic Forum High in his signature black and red. The centerpiece of the release is the striking Forum Boot ($300), a black-on-black hybrid design with a thick sole and elevated upper, channeling high-fashion gritty aesthetics reminiscent of Prada. This ambitious release closes a landmark year for Chavarria and hints at more innovation to come. The collection dropped December 12, 2025, and is available via Adidas and the CONFIRMED app.",

Elordi donned his pair during a Frankenstein-themed press tour event in London on December 7, showcasing his tall and eclectic approach to fashion, while Styles was seen wearing them more casually in Rome on November 28. The loafers, known as \"soft eel loafers,\" are crafted in Italy with detailed pleating and hand-painted soles, reflecting The Row’s reputation for subtle yet high-quality design. This shared footwear choice exemplifies a growing trend among sneaker enthusiasts transitioning toward loafers for their aesthetic versatility rather than abandoning sneakers altogether. The phenomenon underscores a broader menswear movement where style choices align more through evolving taste than deliberate mimicry. Originally featured in British GQ, the article highlights how both celebrities are surfing the loafer wave at the height of its popularity.",

While not as flashy as high-fashion items from brands like Miu Miu or Saint Laurent, the Michael has been celebrated by fashion insiders and publications like GQ for its understated cool, comfort, and robust design that complements various outfits. Formerly a staff favorite at the now-closed Unionmade store in San Francisco, the Michael suits anything from casual jeans to formal slacks and is even wedding-appropriate. Beyond the Michael, Paraboot’s broader catalog includes models like the Reims and Nante loafers and the Thiers, Columbia, and Pacific styles, all exemplifying the brand’s craftsmanship. Known for making their own soles, Paraboot prioritizes quality over affordability, making the Michael not only a trendy item but also a durable, stylish investment.",

## Commonly-cited websites

Parsers for commonly-cited websites like Reddit, G2, etc. are provided out of the box. You can always add your own parsers to your own dashboard and use them with the `parser` parameter.

### Reddit

```python
import requests
import json

API_URL = 'https://api.olostep.com/v1/scrapes'
API_KEY = '<YOUR_TOKEN>'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

payload = {
    'url_to_scrape': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/12h2l9m/anyone_ever_compared_logrocket_to_hotjar_or_others/',
    'formats': ['json'],
    'parser': {
        'id': '@olostep/reddit-post'
    },
}

try:
    print("Starting Olostep API call...")
    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    data = response.json()
    print("Olostep API call completed.")
    print(f"Scrape ID: {data['id']}")
    print(f"URL: {data['url_to_scrape']}")
    print(f"Hosted JSON: {data['result']['json_hosted_url']}")
    json_content = json.loads(data['result']['json_content'])
except Exception as error:
    print(f'Error: {error}')
```

This will return the JSON content of the Reddit post.

## Website crawling

Through the Olostep `/v1/crawls` endpoint you can crawl a website and get the content from all the pages.

- Crawl a website and get the content from all subpages (or limit the depth of the crawl)
- Use special patterns to crawl specific pages (e.g. `/blog/**`)
- Pass a `webhook_url` to get notified when the crawl is completed
- Search query to only find specific pages and sort by relevance

* [Crawl Endpoint API Reference](/api-reference/crawls/create) - For API details.
* [Crawl Python SDK](/sdks/python#smart-web-crawling) - For the Python SDK.
* [Crawl NodeJS SDK](/sdks/node-js#crawling) - For the NodeJS SDK.


## Website mapping

Through the Olostep `/v1/maps` endpoint you can get all the URLs on a website. This is useful for content discovery, site structure analysis (e.g., SEO), or deciding which URLs you want to scrape next.

- Get all URLs on a website (including sitemaps and discovered links)
- Use special patterns to include/exclude paths (e.g. `/blog/**`)
- Paginate large responses with `cursor` (up to 10MB per response)
- Limit volume with `top_n`
