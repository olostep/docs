A benchmark comparing the current Lite, Base and Core processors in the [AI Web Research node](https://docs.gumloop.com/nodes/using_ai/ai_web_research) with Olostep’s [Answers API](/features/answers/answers).

### TL;DR
- **Latency**: `/answers` averages ~5–7s; existing processor on average 60–120s+
- **Freshness**: `/answers` uses live scraping/crawling (no stale index) → more up-to-date.
- **Accuracy**: `/answers` tends to be more accurate and precisethan the existing processors, especially for factual queries.
- **Scope**: Great fit for `lite`/`base`/`core` factual lookups (not deep research - `pro`/`ultra`).
- **Output**: Structured JSON with cited sources; easy to post-process.
- **Integration idea**: Add a new processor (e.g., `core-fast`) that routes to `/answers`.

### How we tested
- Reused example prompts from Gumloop docs across three categories: Lite, Base, Core.
- Measured time-to-first-complete-answer and captured example outputs and sources.
- Verified answers are grounded in real web data.

## Detailed example (Core)

Prompt:
- “Given a competitor list (Gumloop, Make, N8N, Zapier), analyze their pricing strategies and differentiators”

**Existing processor**:
- **Latency**: 2 minutes 47 seconds
- **Output**:
```json
{
  "Competitor Differentiators": {
    "Value #1": "Gumloop differentiates as AI-native automation focusing on AI-first nodes (summarize/extract/categorize) and a visual flow canvas; it emphasizes a credit model that charges primarily for third-party/AI calls rather than for each internal step. It targets teams that want integrated AI workflows with BYO-model support, native model controls, and enterprise security features.",
    "Value #2": "Make’s strengths are a powerful visual scenario builder and strong data-transformation capabilities, offering good cost-to-functionality for medium-complexity workflows. It balances accessibility and advanced features and positions itself as a value-focused alternative to task-based competitors.",
    "Value #3": "n8n’s main differentiators are source-available licensing and self-hosting (full control), extensive coding/customization (JS/Python code nodes), and a pricing model that bills per workflow execution—making it cost-efficient for complex, high-volume workflows when self-hosted. It’s aimed at technical teams and organizations that need data sovereignty and deep customization.",
    "Value #4": "Zapier’s advantages are simplicity, breadth of integrations (largest app catalog), and fast onboarding for non-technical users; itâ€ôs well-suited to quick, simple app-to-app automations and teams that prioritize ease-of-use over deep customization. Its task-based pricing and huge connector ecosystem make it the default for broad SaaS coverage.",
  },
  "Competitor Pricing Strategies": {
    "Value #1": "Gumloop uses a credit-based, subscription model with a freemium entry tier and tiered paid plans (Solo, Team, Enterprise). Credits are consumed when workflows run and for AI/third-party calls, while many native nodes are free; enterprise customers can purchase custom credits and VPC/SSO options.",
    "Value #2": "Make operates an operations/credits-style subscription model (free tier with limited operations, then paid blocks of operations). Pricing is tiered by monthly operation allotments and team/enterprise features; overages or add-on blocks can be purchased as usage grows.",
    "Value #3": "n8n provides a hybrid model: an open-source self-hosted option (free) and a hosted subscription tier billed per workflow execution for the cloud offering. The primary pricing differentiator is that self-hosted users can run unlimited executions (subject to infra costs), while the n8n cloud charges by executions and offers enterprise hosted plans with added SLAs and security features.",
    "Value #4": "Zapier uses a task-based, tiered subscription model with a modest free tier (limited tasks and simple Zaps) and paid plans charging per task; enterprise plans offer custom volume, SSO, and advanced support. Costs grow with the number of tasks/steps processed, making Zapier predictable for low-volume, simple automations but potentially expensive at scale.",
