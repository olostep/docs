title: 'Create AirOps Batch'
description: 'Starts a new AirOps batch with automated LLM extraction fallback'
openapi: POST /v1/airops-batches

## Overview

Starts a batch process that combines standard scraping with LLM-based field extraction. You provide a target `schema`, and the system will automatically identify missing fields after scraping and use an LLM to extract them from the page markdown.

## How it works

1.  **Request Transformation**: The request is validated and passed to the underlying `/batches` system with a hardcoded metadata parser.
2.  **Scraping**: Standard Olostep scrapers attempt to parse the page using rule-based logic.
3.  **Gap Analysis**: After scraping, the system compares the parser output with your requested `schema`.
4.  **Extraction**: Any missing fields are extracted using the specified LLM via the OpenAI Batch API.
