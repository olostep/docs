## Introduction

AirOps Batches provides automated page metadata extraction with LLM enrichment. Submit URLs and receive structured data including page classification, author information, publication dates, and brand mentions.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic page type classification
- Author and date extraction
- Brand mention detection from your provided list
- Smart gap analysis to minimize processing time

## Workflow Phases

The batch progresses through three distinct phases:

```

### Phase 1: Scraping
URLs are scraped and parsed to extract structured data.

### Phase 2: Analyzing
Gap analysis determines which fields need additional extraction. Items with complete data skip enrichment.

### Phase 3: Enriching
Items with missing fields are processed via LLM for additional extraction.

## Target Schema

The system extracts these fields for each URL:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `page_type` | string | Classification of the page content |
| `author` | string | Author of the content (when available) |
| `date_published` | string | Publication date (when available) |
| `date_modified` | string | Last modification date (when available) |
| `brand_mentions` | array | Brands from your list found on the page |

## Page Types

The `page_type` field classifies pages into one of these categories:
