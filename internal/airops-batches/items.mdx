openapi: GET /v1/airops-batches/{batch_id}/items

## Overview

Returns the list of items in the batch, including both the scraping (rule-based) and extraction (LLM-based) results for each item.

## Data Merging

The `extracted_data` contains only the fields that were missing from `parser_data` but present in your requested `schema`. To get the final object, you should merge `extracted_data` into `parser_data` (with `extracted_data` taking precedence).
