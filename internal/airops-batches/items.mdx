title: 'Get Batch Items'
description: 'Retrieve the detailed results for each item in an AirOps batch'
openapi: GET /batches-airops/{batchId}/items
---

## Overview

Returns the list of items in the batch, including both the scraping (rule-based) and extraction (LLM-based) results for each item.

### Response Structure

Each item contains two result objects:
- `scraping`: Data returned by the standard Olostep parser.
- `extraction`: Data returned by the LLM fallback for missing fields.

```json
{
  "id": "batch_x7f2k",
  "items": [
    {
      "custom_id": "p1",
      "url": "https://example.com/page",
      "scraping": {
        "status": "completed",
        "parser_data": { 
          "title": "Example Domain", 
          "content": "..." 
        }
      },
      "extraction": {
        "status": "completed",
        "extracted_data": { 
          "citations": ["https://source.com/1"],
          "summary": "This is a summary."
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "items_count": 1
}
```

## Data Merging

The `extracted_data` contains only the fields that were missing from `parser_data` but present in your requested `schema`. To get the final object, you should merge `extracted_data` into `parser_data` (with `extracted_data` taking precedence).
