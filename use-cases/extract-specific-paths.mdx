title: Get all Blog Urls from Stripe
description: Extract all the urls on stripe that have the path /blog
---

## Overview
If you want to extract all the blog urls from stripe or any website, you can use the maps endpoint to extract all the urls that have the path `/blog` (e.g `https://stripe.com/blog/engineering/page/3`)

## Extracting URLs with a specific path

To extract URLs that follow a specific path from a website, send a POST request with the **url** of the website to be processed to the maps endpoint with the param 'include_urls` as shown here:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python maps.py
    import requests

    url = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/maps"

    payload = {
    "url": "https://stripe.com",
    "include_urls": ["/blog", "/blog/**"],
    }
    headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

    response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    print(response.text)
    ```
</CodeGroup>
