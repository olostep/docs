description: Olostep provides the most affordable Google search results in 1-3 seconds. Get structured search results data in JSON format
---

## Overview

Olostep's API allows you to extract structured data from search engine results by using custom parsers. These parsers transform the raw HTML of search results into clean, structured JSON data that's ready for analysis or integration into your applications.

## Using Custom Parsers

You can get structured results from search engines by passing custom parsers to the Olostep API. In this example, we'll see how users can get JSON data from Google search results.

We also offer specialized parsers for other Google services:
- Google News
- Google Images
- Google Maps
- Google Places
- Google Videos

Please contact us at [info@olostep.com](mailto:info@olostep.com) to get access to these additional parsers or to discuss creating custom parsers for your specific use cases.

## Integration Example

To get parsed JSON content from search results, you need to include `parser_extract` in the `formats` parameter and specify the name of the parser in the `parser_extract` object.

Here's how to retrieve Google search results in a structured format:

```python
import requests
import json

endpoint = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/scrapes"
payload = {
    "formats": ["parser_extract"],
    "parser_extract": {"parser_id": "@olostep/google-search"},
    "url_to_scrape": "https://www.google.com/search?q=alexander+the+great&gl=us&hl=en",
    "wait_before_scraping": 0,
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR-API-KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.request("POST", endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4))
```

## Response Format

When you make a request to the Olostep API with the Google Search parser, you'll receive a structured JSON response like the example below:

```json

    "id": "scrape_94iqy385ty",
    "object": "scrape",

The response contains:

- **Basic request information**: `id`, `object`, `created` timestamp, `url_to_scrape`
- **Result object** with URLs to access different formats of the data
- **JSON content** with structured search results including:
- `searchParameters`: Information about the search query
- `knowledgeGraph`: Detailed information about the search subject (when available)
- `organic`: List of search results with title, link, position, and snippet
- `peopleAlsoAsk`: Related questions that users commonly search for
- `relatedSearches`: Suggested related search queries


For the URL in this example, Olostep will also provide a hosted JSON file with the structured search results. You can access the JSON file using the `json_hosted_url` field in the response:

- Structured JSON: [View example JSON](https://olostep-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/json_vxc86vq2pf.json)

If you want to also get the HTML and Markdown content of the search results, you can include these formats in the `formats` parameter and Olostep will return them in the response and provide hosted URLs for each format.
- [Markdown format](https://olostep-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/markDown_vxc86vq2pf.txt)
- [HTML](https://olostep-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/text_vxc86vq2pf.txt)


## Conclusion
Passing custom parsers to the API allows you to only get the structured data you want. This makes it easy to integrate search results into your applications, perform data analysis, or build search-related features.
