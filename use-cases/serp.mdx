description: SERP API to scrape Google search results using Olostep and a Python code snippet.
---

## Overview

Olostep's API allows you to extract structured data from search engine results by using [parsers](../../features/structured-content/parsers). These parsers transform the raw HTML of search results into clean, structured JSON data that's ready for analysis or integration into your applications.


## Integration Example

To get parsed JSON content from search results, you need to include `parser_extract` in the `formats` parameter and specify the name of the parser `@olostep/google-search` in the `parser_extract` object.

Here's how to retrieve Google search results in a structured format:

```python
import requests
import json

endpoint = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/scrapes"
payload = {
    "formats": ["parser_extract"],
    "parser_extract": {"parser_id": "@olostep/google-search"},
    "url_to_scrape": "https://www.google.com/search?q=alexander+the+great&gl=us&hl=en",
    "wait_before_scraping": 0,
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR-API-KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.request("POST", endpoint, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4))
```

## Response Format

When you make a request to the Olostep API with the Google Search parser, you'll receive a JSON response like the example below:

```json

    "id": "scrape_94iqy385ty",
    "object": "scrape",

Olostep provides also a hosted JSON file with the structured search results. You can access the JSON file using the `json_hosted_url` field in the response:

- Structured JSON: [View example JSON](https://olostep-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/json_vxc86vq2pf.json)

If you want to also get the HTML and Markdown content of the search results, you can include these formats in the `formats` parameter and Olostep will return them in the response and provide hosted URLs for each format.
- [Markdown format](https://olostep-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/markDown_vxc86vq2pf.txt)
- [HTML](https://olostep-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/text_vxc86vq2pf.txt)

## Important Notes

**Search Parameters**: The `gl=us` and `hl=en` parameters set the geolocation to US and language to English. Adjust these as needed.


## Conclusion
Passing custom parsers to the API allows you to only get the structured data you want. This makes it easy to integrate search results into your applications, perform data analysis, or build search-related features.
