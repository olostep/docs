## Overview

Before diving into specific sections of a website, it's often useful to get a complete picture of its structure. In this guide, we'll show you how to extract all URLs from Stripe's website, which will help you:

- Understand the overall site architecture
- Discover content sections you might not be aware of
- Use LLMs to decide which URLs to further scrape

## Extracting All Stripe URLs

To extract all URLs from Stripe's website, use the maps endpoint with Stripe's domain. This will return a comprehensive list of all discoverable URLs on their site.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python get_stripe_urls.py
    import requests
    import time
    import json

    # Configuration
    API_URL = 'https://api.olostep.com/v1'
    API_KEY = '<your_olostep_api_key>'
    HEADERS = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'
    }

    # Start time for latency tracking
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Define the payload with just the base URL
    payload = {
        "url": "https://stripe.com"
    }
    
    # Make the request
    response = requests.post(f'{API_URL}/maps', headers=HEADERS, json=payload)
    
    # Calculate latency
    latency = round((time.time() - start_time) * 1000, 2)
    print(f"Request completed in {latency}ms")
    
    # Process the results
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Found {data['urls_count']} URLs on Stripe's website")
    
    # Print the first 10 URLs as a sample
    print("\nSample URLs:")
    for url in data['urls'][:10]:
        print(f"- {url}")
        
    # Save all URLs to a file for further analysis
    with open('stripe_urls.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
    print(f"\nAll URLs saved to stripe_urls.json")
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": "map_abc123xyz",
  "urls_count": 3842,
  "urls": [
    "https://stripe.com",
    "https://stripe.com/about",
    "https://stripe.com/blog",
    "https://stripe.com/docs",
    "https://stripe.com/pricing",
    "https://stripe.com/customers",
    "https://stripe.com/partners",
    "https://stripe.com/enterprise",
    "https://stripe.com/payments",
    "https://stripe.com/billing"
    // ... thousands more URLs
  ]
}
```

## Analyzing Stripe's Website Structure

After extracting all URLs, you can analyze the structure to identify patterns. This is particularly useful for understanding how Stripe organizes their content. For example, you might notice these URL patterns:

- `/blog/**` - Blog posts and articles
- `/docs/**` - Documentation pages
- `/payments/**` - Payment product information
- `/billing/**` - Billing product information

In some cases, you only want to get URLs in a specific section of the website. For instance, all blog posts. You can use our inbuilt filter in the [next guide](/use-cases/extract-specific-paths).
