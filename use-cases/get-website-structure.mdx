## Overview
This is useful for content discovery, site structure analysis or decide which of those URLs you want to get the content from.

## Extracting Sitemaps

To extract URLs from a website, send a POST request with the **url** of the website to be processed to the maps endpoint. The endpoint typically responds within seconds, providing a comprehensive list of URLs

<CodeGroup>
    ```python maps.py
    import requests
    import time

    # Define the API URL and your API key
    API_URL = 'https://api.olostep.com'
    API_KEY = '<your_token>'

    # Set the headers for the requests
    HEADERS = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'
    }

    # Data for the request
    payload = {
        "url": "https://docs.olostep.com"
    }

    # Make the request and measure latency
    start_time = time.time()
    response = requests.post(f'{API_URL}/v1/maps', headers=HEADERS, json=payload)
    latency = round((time.time() - start_time) * 1000, 2)

    # Print results
    print(f"Latency: {latency}ms")
    print("\nResponse Status Code:", response.status_code)
    print("\nResponse Body:")
    print(response.text)
    ```

```

The response will include all discovered sitemap URLs for the specified website. This endpoint is particularly useful when you need to:
- Discover all content pages on a website
- Filter which URLs you want to get content from with the scrapes endpoint
- Analyze site structure and hierarchy
- Prepare URLs for batch processing
