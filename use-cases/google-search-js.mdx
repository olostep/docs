# Google Search Scraper with Olostep

This guide demonstrates how to use the Olostep API to scrape Google search results and parse them into structured JSON data. This is particularly useful for automating research tasks, gathering competitive intelligence, or building applications that require search data.

## How It Works

The example below in Javascript shows how to search for a LinkedIn profile URL of a specific person (Patrick Collison) using Google search and Olostep's google search parser `@olostep/google-search`

```javascript
async function scrapeGoogleSearch(apiKey, query = "site%3Alinkedin.com+Patrick+Collison") {
  const endpoint = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/scrapes";

  const payload = {
    "formats": ["parser_extract"],
    "parser_extract": {"parser_id": "@olostep/google-search"},
    "url_to_scrape": `https://www.google.com/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}&gl=us&hl=en`,
    "wait_before_scraping": 0,
  };

  const headers = {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  };

  try {
    const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: headers,
      body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 4));
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Replace <API_KEY> with your actual Olostep API key
scrapeGoogleSearch("<API_KEY>");
```

## Response Format

When you make a request to the Olostep API with the Google Search parser, you'll receive a JSON response like the example below:

```json
