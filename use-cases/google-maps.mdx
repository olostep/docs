description: SERP API to scrape Google Maps location data using Olostep and a Python code snippet.
---

## Overview

Olostep's API allows you to extract structured data from Google Maps locations by using parsers. These parsers transform the raw HTML of Google Maps pages into clean, structured JSON data that's ready for analysis or integration into your applications.

## Integration Example

To get parsed JSON content from Google Maps results, you need to include parser_extract in the formats parameter and specify the name of the parser @olostep/google-maps in the parser_extract object.
Here's how to retrieve Google Maps location data in a structured format:

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://api.olostep.com/v1/scrapes"
payload = {
"url_to_scrape": "https://www.google.com/maps/search/Coffee+on+the+Rocks/@40.3699261,-105.5321621,17z?hl=en",
"formats": ["parser_extract"],
"parser_extract": {"parser_id": "@olostep/google-maps"},
"remove_css_selectors": "none"
}
headers = {
"Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR-API-KEY>",
"Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4))
```

## Response Format
When you make a request to the Olostep API with the Google Maps parser, you'll receive a JSON response like the example below:

```json
{
"id": "scrape_brbeksysng",
"object": "scrape",
"created": 1711069122,
"metadata": {},
"retrieve_id": "brbeksysng",
"url_to_scrape": "https://www.google.com/maps/search/Coffee+on+the+Rocks/@40.3699261,-105.5321621,17z?hl=en",
"result": {
"html_content": null,
"markdown_content": null,
"text_content": null,
"json_content": "...", // Full JSON content will be here
"llm_extract": null,

"text_hosted_url": null,
"links_on_page": [],
"page_metadata": {
"status_code": 200,
"title": ""
}
}
}
```

The response contains:

- **Basic request information**: `id`, `object`, `created` timestamp, `url_to_scrape`
- **Result object** with URLs to access different formats of the data
- **json_content** with structured search results including:

- `Business details` (name, address, contact information)

Olostep provides a hosted JSON file with the structured location data. You can access the JSON file using the json_hosted_url field in the response:

- Structured JSON: [View example JSON](https://olostep-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/json_brbeksysng.json)

If you want to also get the HTML and Markdown content of the location data, you can include these formats in the formats parameter and Olostep will return them in the response and provide hosted URLs for each format.
