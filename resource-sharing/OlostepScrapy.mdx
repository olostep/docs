## Introduction
OlostepScrapy uses a peer to peer network built on Chromium Browser users. All users are anonymous, consensual and the proxies are ethically sourced. Nodes are protected using anonymization and enforced rate limiting.
Every node in the network is a browser that loads the website and runs your scripts. It is a distributed system that allows you to build reliable and cheap web scrapers.

## Implementation
Under the hood, OlostepScrapy uses an "allocator" (a serverless Lambda function) listening for incoming requests. When a request is received, the "allocator"  will find the best node to handle the request and send the url/script to the node. All nodes are listening thanks to a network of webhooks. The node which receives the request, will then run the script and send the results back to the "allocator". The "allocator" will finally send the results back to the API caller.

Ajax and Fetch requests are used to load the actual websites. The web scraping implementation is run after having parsed the HTML using the DOMParser() API. For more complex scenarios, the websites are loaded inside a secured, sandboxed iframe and the JS is run inside the iframe.
