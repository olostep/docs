## Information
This library uses [Mozilla's webextension-polyfill library](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) internally for compatability across browsers which means it should work on almost all modern browsers.
For now, the only regularly tested browser is Chrome, but it should work on Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Brave. If you find a compatibility bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/olostep/OlostepExt/issues/new).


The library works both for manifest v2 and v3.


**Note**: The Olostep JS Library doesn't track your users. This library only communicates with Olostep's servers to process tips/donations.

## Installing

<Steps>
    <Step title="Import">
        Copy the [OlostepExt.js](https://github.com/olostep/OlostepExt/blob/main/OlostepExt/OlostepExt.js) file into your project. If you're using a bundler like Webpack or Rollup, make sure to add OlostepExt in your final bundle.

        For example, in Webpack, you can add the following to your webpack.config.js file to copy OlostepExt into your final bundle:
        ```js webpack.config.js
        const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');
        // ...
        plugins: [
            new CopyPlugin({
                patterns: [
                    { from: "./src/OlostepExt.js", to: "OlostepExt.js" },
                ],
            }),
        ],
        // ...
        ```
        **Note**: A npm package is coming soon.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure your manifest.json">
        Olostep needs the following configuration in your manifest.json (for both manifest v2 and v3):
        ```
        {
            "permissions": [
                "storage"
            ]
        }
        ```
        You will also need to expose the OlostepExt.js file as web-accessible resource in your manifest.json.
        The syntax varies depending on whether you are using manifest v3 or v2.
        <CodeGroup>
        ```manifest manifest v3
        {
            "web_accessible_resources": [
                {
                    "resources": [
                        "OlostepExt.js"
                    ],
                    "matches": [
                        "<all_urls>"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        ```manifest manifest v2
        {
            "web_accessible_resources": [
                "OlostepExt.js"
            ]
        }
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add OlostepExt to background.js">
        You need to put OlostepExt in your background file, often named something like background.js. If you don't include OlostepExt in your background file, it won't work correctly.

        With either Manifest v3 or Manifest v2, you'll need to [sign up and register an extension](https://www.olostep.com/olostep-auth/). When you register an extension, you'll create a public configuration_key that you'll use when initializing OlostepExt. We'll use "olostep_pk_sample_extension" as the configuration_key in the following examples.

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Manifest v3">
                You can use the [importScripts()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts) method to import OlostepExt into your background file.

                Let's say you have set up your manifest.json file like this:
                ```manifest manifest.json
                {
                    "background": {
                        "service_worker": "background.js"
                    }
                }
                ```
                You can import OlostepExt into your background.js file like this:
                ```js background.js
                importScripts('OlostepExt.js')
                let olostep = OlostepExt("olostep_pk_sample_extension");
                olostep.init();
                ```
                The `init()` method will initialize Olostep (by fetching your Stripe/PayPal configuration, your products, prices...) and set up the necessary listeners to communicate with your extension's content scripts.

                If you don't call `init()`, Olostep will not work correctly.

                **Note about service workers**: In the example above, OlostepExt will become undefined when accessed in service worker callbacks. To use OlostepExt in service worker callbacks, redeclare it like so:
                ```js background.js
                chrome.storage.local.get('alan-kay', function() {
                    let olostep = OlostepExt("olostep_pk_sample_extension");
                    // ...
                })
                ```
                Make sure to redeclare OlostepExt in each service worker callback that uses it.

                **Don't call `init()` again in service worker callbacks.** It will cause Olostep to stop working correctly.
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Manifest v2">
                Add OlostepExt to your manifest.json file like this:
                ```manifest manifest.json
                {
                    "background": {
                        "scripts": [
                            "OlostepExt.js",
                            "background.js"
                        ]
                    }
                }
                ```
                Then, in your background.js file, initialize OlostepExt like this:
                ```js background.js
                let olostep = OlostepExt("olostep_pk_sample_extension");
                olostep.init();
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Import OlostepExt inside your contentscript.js">
        You can only call the `olostep.tips.request()` method from your extension's content scripts (or HTML pages) since it needs a valid DOM to render the request window.

        If you try to call it from your background.js file, it will throw an error. If you want, you can send a message from your background.js file to your content script to trigger the `olostep.tips.request()` method.

        This is how you need to setup your manifest.json file in order to use Olostep in your content scripts:
        <CodeGroup>
        ```manifest manifest v3/v2
        "content_scripts": [
            {
                "matches": [
                    "<all_urls>"
                ],
                "js": [
                    "OlostepExt.js",
                    "content.js"
                ]
            }
        ]
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
        Then, in your content.js file, you can import Olostep and start using the APIs (like `olostep.tips.request()` or `olostep.users.get()`).

        You don't need to call `init()` in your content scripts. It's only needed in your background.js file.
        ```js content.js
        let olostep = OlostepExt("olostep_pk_sample_extension");

        // Implement API calls here...
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Import OlostepExt inside HTML pages (optional - Coming Soon)">
        What if you want to use OlostepExt inside your HTML pages and you don't have a content script?

        You can use the OlostepWeb JS library to do that.

        It's a mirror of the OlostepExt JS library, but it doesn't need to be imported in your manifest.json file. You can import it directly in your HTML pages.

        Instead of relying on browser specific APIs, it uses equivalent web alternatives.

        In future releases, it will be also able to communicate with OlostepExt to get the same exact functionalities and sync data between your extension and your HTML pages.

        You can import it either from the CDN or from your local files.
        <CodeGroup>
        ```html CDN
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/olostep/olostep-extensions/OlostepWeb.js"></script>
        ```
        ```html Local
        <script src="OlostepWeb.js"></script>
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
        Then, you can initialize it with your configuration_key:
        ```js
        let olostep = OlostepWeb("olostep_pk_sample_extension");
        olostep.init();
        ```
        After you initialize it, you can use the same APIs as OlostepExt.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## A note on popup.html

A common use case of the OlostepExt JS library is to use it in your extension's popup.html

popup.html files are HTML pages that are displayed when your users click on your extension's icon in their browser's toolbar.

They are useful to display a small UI to your users and allow them to interact with your extension and tip you.

You can't use the Olostep JS library directly in your popup.html file because it's not a content script. You can't use the OlostepWeb JS library either.

But you can send a message from your popup.html file to your content script to trigger the `olostep.tips.request()` method.

Here's an example of how you can do that:

```js popup.js
// popup.js
function popup() {
    chrome.tabs.query({currentWindow: true, active: true}, function (tabs){
        var activeTab = tabs[0];
        chrome.tabs.sendMessage(activeTab.id, {"message": "request-olostep-tip"});
    });
}

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    document.getElementById("button1").addEventListener("click", popup);
});
```

```html popup.html
<!-- popup.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Popup</title>
        <script src="popup.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <button id="button1">Click me</button>
    </body>
</html>
```

```js content.js
// content.js
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(
    function(request, sender, sendResponse) {
        if( request.message === "request-olostep-tip" ) {
            olostep.tips.request({
                  item: "coffee",
                  price_per_item: 300,
                  currency: "USD",
                  //...
            });
        }
    }
);
```
