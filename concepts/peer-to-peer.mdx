## Introduction
The Olostep API uses a network of nodes built on desktop clients/chromium users. Nodes are protected using anonymization and by enforced rate limiting.
Every node in the network loads the website and runs your scripts. It is a distributed system that allows you to build reliable and cheap web scrapers.

## Implementation
Under the hood, Olostep uses an "allocator" listening for incoming requests. When a request is received, the "allocator" will find the best node to handle the request and send the url/script to the node.

Ajax and Fetch requests are used to load the actual websites. The web scraping implementation is run after having parsed the HTML using the `DOMParser()` API.
