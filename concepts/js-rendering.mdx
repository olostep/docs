## Explanation
With Olostep, every scrape happens with JS rendering enabled by default. This avoids anti-bot measures and is especially useful for websites that use frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, etc.
It also allows you to scrape websites that use JS to load their content, such as infinite scrolling, lazy loading, etc.

Every request you make with Olostep is rendered in a real browser (or a good approximation â€” depending on the node), so you can scrape any website that you can access with your browser.
The rendering engine is the V8 engine, the same engine used by Chromium browsers.
