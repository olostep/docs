description: Extract structured data from AI-powered search engines using batch requests
---

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use Olostep's Batches endpoint to fetch data from popular AI search tools including Google AI Mode, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overview.

By leveraging specialized parsers for each platform, you can extract structured search results at scale, making it ideal for:
- Competitive intelligence gathering
- Multi-platform search result comparison
- AI search engine monitoring

## Request Formulation

### Step 1: Prepare Your Queries

Create an array of queries you want to search. For this demo, we'll query news across different cities:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

// Configuration
const CONFIG = {
  url: 'https://api.olostep.com/v1/batches',
  token: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
};

// Demo: Generate queries for different cities
const BASE_QUERY = 'what is the news today in';
const CITIES = [
  'New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix',
  'Philadelphia', 'San Antonio', 'San Diego', 'Dallas', 'San Jose'
];
```

### Step 2: Generate Items for Each AI Tool

Each AI search tool requires a specific parser ID and URL structure. Below are the item generation functions for each platform:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Google AI Mode">
    **Parser ID:** `@olostep/google-aimode-results`
    
    ```javascript
    const generateAIModeItems = () => {
      return CITIES.map((city, index) => {
        const query = `${BASE_QUERY} ${city}`;
        const encodedQuery = encodeURIComponent(query);
        return {
          url: `https://google.com/aimode?q=${encodedQuery}`,
          custom_id: (index + 1).toString()
        };
      });
    };
    ```
 </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="ChatGPT">
    **Parser ID:** `@olostep/chatgpt-results`
    
    ```javascript
    const generateChatGPTItems = () => {
      return CITIES.map((city, index) => {
        const query = `${BASE_QUERY} ${city}`;
        const encodedQuery = encodeURIComponent(query);
        return {
          url: `https://chatgpt.com/?q=${encodedQuery}`,
          custom_id: (index + 1).toString()
        };
      });
    };
    ```
    
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Perplexity">
    **Parser ID:** `@olostep/perplexity-results`
    
    ```javascript
    const generatePerplexityItems = () => {
      return CITIES.map((city, index) => {
        const query = `${BASE_QUERY} ${city}`;
        const encodedQuery = encodeURIComponent(query);
        return {
          url: `https://www.perplexity.ai/?q=${encodedQuery}`,
          custom_id: (index + 1).toString()
        };
      });
    };
    ```
    
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Google AI Overview">
    **Parser ID:** `@olostep/google-ai-overview-results`
    
    ```javascript
    const generateGoogleAIOverviewItems = () => {
      return CITIES.map((city, index) => {
        const query = `${BASE_QUERY} ${city}`;
        const encodedQuery = encodeURIComponent(query);
        return {
          url: `https://www.google.com/search?q=${encodedQuery}`,
          custom_id: (index + 1).toString()
        };
      });
    };
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Gemini">
    **Parser ID:** `@olostep/gemini-results`
    
    ```javascript
    const generateGeminiItems = () => {
      return CITIES.map((city, index) => {
        const query = `${BASE_QUERY} ${city}`;
        const encodedQuery = encodeURIComponent(query);
        return {
          url: `https://gemini.google.com/?q=${encodedQuery}`,
          custom_id: (index + 1).toString()
        };
      });
    };
    ```
    
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Microsoft Copilot">
    **Parser ID:** `@olostep/microsoft-copilot-results`
    
    ```javascript
    const generateCopilotItems = () => {
      return CITIES.map((city, index) => {
        const query = `${BASE_QUERY} ${city}`;
        const encodedQuery = encodeURIComponent(query);
        return {
          url: `https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats?q=${encodedQuery}`,
          custom_id: (index + 1).toString()
        };
      });
    };
    ```
    
  </Tab>
   <Tab title="Grok">
    **Parser ID:** `@olostep/grok-results`
    
    ```javascript
    const generateGrokItems = () => {
      return CITIES.map((city, index) => {
        const query = `${BASE_QUERY} ${city}`;
        const encodedQuery = encodeURIComponent(query);
        return {
          url: `https://grok.com/?q=${encodedQuery}`,
          custom_id: (index + 1).toString()
        };
      });
    };
    ```
    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Submit the Batch Request

Submit your batch request with the generated items:

```javascript
const response = await axios.post(CONFIG.url, {
  parser: { id: '@olostep/gemini-results' },
  items: generateGeminiItems()
}, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${CONFIG.token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const batchId = response.data.id;
```

**Note:** After submitting, [poll for completion](/use-cases/batch#step-2-monitor-batch-status) to retrieve results.

## Response Format

After submitting a batch request and polling for completion, you'll receive responses in the following format:
