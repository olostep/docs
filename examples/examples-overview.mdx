Here you will find examples on how to use the Olostep API to scrape web pages.

In order to scrape a web page, you need to change only two parameters in the code:
1. Your API keys (you can request one for free [here](https://p5iqqpnnrjy.typeform.com/to/aq0SOcev?typeform-source=www.olostep.com))
2. The URL of the page you want to scrape.

All other parameters are optional and already set to default values. If you want to change them, you can do so by passing them as query parameters to the endpoint.
You can find the list of parameters under the "Query Parameters" section [here](https://docs.olostep.com/api-reference/start-agent).

Results are returned as a json object =>  `{"defaultDatasetId": "defaultDatasetId_mngjljq1qc",
                                            "html_content": "",
                                            "markdown_content": " Alexander the Great - Wikipedia...",
                                            "text_content": "",
                                            "usedProvidedNodeCountry": True
                                            }`
