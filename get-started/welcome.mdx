Olostep is the world's fastest and most cost-effective Web Scraping API.

It delivers results in 1-5 seconds, avoids all bot detection and can handle millions of requests in 5-7 minutes. It supports Markdown conversion and PDF support. The API returns html/markdown but you can also get structured data in JSON format. To get structured data you can either use our pre-built parsers for some common websites (Amazon, Google search results, Linkedin) or pass your own selectors to the API. Alternatively you can let our LLM extract the data for you.

Olostep is used by developers, startups, and scaleups to extract data from websites at scale for data enrichment, automate workflows with AI, power price monitoring services and to monitor data on any website at regular intervals. It's also used as a Google and Bing search API (SERP) and to give AIs a tool to navigate and do research over the Web.
