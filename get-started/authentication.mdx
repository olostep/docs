title: 'Authentication'
---

The API endpoints require that you authenticate using an API token.

## Generate a token

The token can be generated from Olostep dashboard. Please sign in [here](https://www.olostep.com/olostep-auth/).

For now, you'll also need an invite code. Please either [send us a message](https://olostep-users.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2bfddyi8h-JzfjOgavg~98DJ1om1B5Lg#/shared-invite/email) in the Slack community or schedule a [10-minute chat](https://calendly.com/arslanali-972-89/video-call) to get your invite.

## Use your token

You can authenticate by adding an `Authorization` header to all your HTTP calls. The Authorization header is formatted as such: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (replace `<token>` with your token previously generated).

Example:

```sh
curl -L -X GET 'https://agent.olostep.com/olostep-p2p-incomingAPI?url=myURL' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer myAwesomeToken'
```
