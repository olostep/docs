The API endpoints require that you authenticate using an API token.

## Generate a token

The token can be generated from the Olostep dashboard. Please create an account [here](https://www.olostep.com/auth/).

## Use your token

You can authenticate by adding an `Authorization` header to all your HTTP calls. The Authorization header is formatted as such: `Authorization: Bearer <API-TOKEN>` (replace `<API-TOKEN>` with your token. If you don't have a token, you can generate one for free from the Olostep [dashboard](https://www.olostep.com/dashboard/).

Example:

```sh
curl -L -X GET 'https://api.olostep.com/v1/scrapes/scrape_id' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <API-TOKEN>'
```
