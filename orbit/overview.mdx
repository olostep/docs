Build and ship agentic browser apps and extensions with OS‑level and browser‑level APIs. Orbit is a desktop-first runtime designed for B2B teams building web agents and AI automations.

### What makes an agentic browser

- **Desktop‑first**: Native desktop app for secure access to OS‑level capabilities.
- **Works with any browser**: Control Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, Comet, etc... — no consumer browser lock‑in.
- **Built‑in distribution**: Package and ship apps via the Orbit webstore.
- **Web Navigation & data engine**: Pre‑built web navigation and retrieval using the Olostep AI SDK.
- **Automation framework**: Expose APIs to agents, manage auth, orchestrate flows, and control browsers via CDP, Playwright, or Selenium.
- **Enterprise‑grade**: Access controls, encrypted storage, and compliance‑ready primitives.

### Build on Orbit

- **Browser control**: Drive Chrome/Edge/Firefox via CDP, Playwright, or Selenium. Navigate, click, fill, and extract reliably.
- **Auth & 2FA helpers**: Session management, local cookie access (where permitted), and secure multi‑factor flows.
- **OS‑level APIs**: File system, app launching, clipboard, notifications, and more — with least‑privilege access.
- **Pre-built AI SDK**: Use a prebuilt AI SDK for search, web navigation, and structured extraction to power your agents.
- **Policy & controls**: Role‑based access, audit trails, guardrails, and rate limits for production workloads.
- **Security by default**: Encryption, scoped tokens, and tenant isolation.

### Already have a browser extension?

Bring your existing Chrome/Edge/Firefox extension to Orbit and ship it as an agentic app with native capabilities.

- Keep your existing codebase
- Cross-browser by default: Ship it once, make it work on any major browser
- Access more powerful APIs
- Reliable auth with session helpers and cookie access (where permitted)
- Monetize from other AI companies with licenses and metering
