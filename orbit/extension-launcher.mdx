Launch your existing Chrome/Edge/Firefox extension on Orbit and unlock OS‑level capabilities without rebuilding your app.

### Why use the Extension Launcher

- **Bring your extension as‑is**: Keep your codebase; map your `manifest.json` to Orbit.
- **Native capabilities**: Use files, clipboard, notifications, and app launch with least‑privilege access.
- **Reliable auth**: Session helpers, cookie access (where permitted), and secure 2FA flows.
- **Distribution**: Ship via the Orbit webstore with licenses and metering.

### Quick start

1. Prepare your extension package (ZIP or folder with `manifest.json`).
2. Open Orbit and select Extension Launcher → Import.
3. Map permissions and background/service worker to Orbit equivalents.
4. Enable optional OS‑level APIs (files, clipboard, notifications).
5. Test locally, then publish to the Orbit webstore.

### Manifest mapping

Orbit supports common Chrome/Firefox manifest fields. When importing, you will be prompted to map:

- `permissions` → Orbit capabilities (tabs, storage, cookies, notifications)
- `background`/`service_worker` → Orbit background process
- `host_permissions` → Allowed origins
- `commands` → Orbit shortcuts

### Add OS‑level APIs

Opt‑in to additional capabilities for agentic workflows:

- File system access
- Clipboard read/write
- Notifications
- App launch and deep links

### Publish and monetize

- Versioned releases with staged rollouts
- License keys and usage metering
- Team and enterprise deployment options
