## Available Tools

- **search_google**: Searches Google for the given query and returns the search results
- **get_website_urls**: Retrieves all URLs from a website and filters out the irrelevant ones


## Installation
To set up Olostep MCP Server, you need to have an API key. You can get the API key by signing up on the [Olostep website](https://olostep.com/auth).

### Running with npx

```bash
env OLOSTEP_API_KEY=your-api-key npx -y olostep-mcp
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
npm install -g olostep-mcp
```

### Running on Claude Desktop

You can install Olostep MCP Server via [Smithery CLI](https://smithery.ai/server/@olostep/olostep-mcp-server) for [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @olostep/olostep-mcp-server --client claude
```

Or you can add this to your claude_desktop_config.json:

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-olostep": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "olostep-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OLOSTEP_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Running on Windsurf
Add this to your ./codeium/windsurf/model_config.json:

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-olostep": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "olostep-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OLOSTEP_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Running on Cursor
To configure Olostep MCP in Cursor:

- Open Cursor Settings
- Go to Features > MCP Servers
- Click "+ Add New MCP Server"
 - Enter the following: Name: "olostep-mcp" (or your preferred name) Type: "command"
 - Command: `env OLOSTEP_API_KEY=your-api-key npx -y olostep-mcp`

Replace `your-api-key` with your Olostep API key.

> If you are using Windows and are having issues, try `cmd /c "set OLOSTEP_API_KEY=your-api-key && npx -y olostep-mcp"`

Then refresh the MCP server list to see the new tools. The Composer will automatically use Olostep MCP when needed.

You can also explicitly request it by describing how you want to get data from the web. Access the Composer via Command+L (Mac), select "Agent" next to the submit button, and enter your query.
